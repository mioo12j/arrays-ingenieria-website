# ----------------------------------------------------------------- FAQ ----
FAQ = [
    ("What does Arrays Ingenieria do?",
     "Arrays Ingenieria is a veteran-led solar contractor. We do three things: installation & commissioning (I&C) of solar plants, "
     "complete EPC (engineering, procurement and construction), and all the civil works a plant needs, from pile foundations to "
     "boundary walls and fencing. We work on the CAPEX model, so the plant belongs to our client."),
    ("Do you manufacture solar panels or inverters?",
     "No. We are an installation, EPC and civil company, not a manufacturer. We source Tier-1 modules, inverters and balance-of-system "
     "equipment from established manufacturers, or use the makes approved by our client or the lead EPC, such as Tata Power-approved makes."),
    ("What is the CAPEX model for solar?",
     "Under CAPEX you pay for the plant and own it from day one. We design, supply and build it; every unit it generates is yours, "
     "and there is no long-term power purchase agreement. Businesses that own the plant may also claim accelerated depreciation "
     "under the Income Tax Act; check the current rate with your tax adviser."),
    ("Do you offer OPEX, RESCO or zero-investment solar?",
     "No, we do not finance or own plants. If your organisation prefers an OPEX or RESCO arrangement, the developer that finances "
     "the plant can engage us as its installation and EPC partner, as Tata Power Renewable Energy and Sustvest have done for tea "
     "estates in Assam."),
    ("What is the difference between CAPEX and OPEX solar?",
     "With CAPEX you invest upfront, own the plant and keep all the savings. With OPEX or RESCO a developer invests and owns the plant, "
     "and you buy its power at an agreed tariff for many years. CAPEX usually gives the highest lifetime savings; OPEX avoids the upfront cost."),
    ("What does solar installation & commissioning (I&C) include?",
     "I&C covers everything on site after the design and equipment are fixed: mounting structures, module installation, DC and AC "
     "cabling, inverters and distribution boards, earthing and lightning protection, testing, grid synchronisation and commissioning."),
    ("Do you work as a subcontractor for EPC companies and developers?",
     "Yes, it is a large part of our work. Tata Power has engaged us for pile foundations on the 300 MW SECI project at Koppal, civil "
     "works on the 10 MW DCM Textile plant in Hisar and piling and civil works for the 5.5 MW Tata Motors plant in Jamshedpur, and "
     "Sustvest for the installation and commissioning of 1711.66 kWp in Assam."),
    ("What civil works do you carry out for solar plants?",
     "Pile foundations for module mounting structures, RCC works, pre-cast boundary walls, chain-link fencing, earthing with its "
     "civil work, and cable trays and conduits with their supports."),
    ("Can a solar plant work alongside our diesel generators?",
     "Yes. At Jay Shree Tea's Towkok and Manjushree estates the scope included synchronising each solar plant with two DG sets, so "
     "the estates can run solar and generators together."),
    ("Do you handle net-metering and DISCOM approvals?",
     "Yes. At Barpatra Tea Estate in Assam we obtained the net-metering and statutory approvals from APDCL, including its technical "
     "inspections, so the plant could start on schedule."),
    ("How many tea-estate solar plants have you built?",
     "As reported in September 2026, Arrays Ingenieria has installed 19 on-grid solar plants in Assam's tea gardens, for estates "
     "including those of Jay Shree Tea (BK Birla Group) and Goodricke Group."),
    ("Where in India do you work?",
     "Across India. Our projects span Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Karnataka. Our "
     "corporate office is in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, with a branch office in Madhubani, Bihar."),
    ("Who runs Arrays Ingenieria?",
     "The company was founded in 2018 by Lt. Gen. Ashish Ranjan Prasad (Retd), AVSM, VSM, ADC, former Signal Officer-in-Chief of the "
     "Indian Army, and is run by ex-servicemen who bring military discipline, safety and timeliness to every site."),
    ("Which certifications do you hold?",
     "We are ISO 9001:2015 (quality), ISO 14001:2015 (environment) and ISO 45001:2018 (occupational health & safety) certified, and "
     "a registered MSME (Udyam UDYAM-DL-03-0023905)."),
    ("How do I get a quote?",
     "Send us your site location, the type of plant (rooftop or ground-mount), the approximate capacity or your monthly electricity "
     "bill, and whether you need full EPC, I&C only or civil works only. Use the contact form or email arraysingenieria@gmail.com."),
